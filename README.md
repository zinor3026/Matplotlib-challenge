# Matplotlib-challenge
Module 5 Challenge
##Description:
 In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
 ##Installations
 We use Matplotlib, pandas, scipy and numpy to calculate aggregates, visualize the data and to clean the data.
 ##Other Instructions:
 Comments above each block of code helps understand this project better. Each comment defines the idea and motive behind every code.
 ## Contributing
 The activities done during the class for Module 5 was very helpful. I refered to the activities and the codes used during each classes.
 out= dict(markerfacecolor = "red",marker ="o" ) ax1.boxplot(tvol_data, labels = treatment, flierprops = out) :Came up to this code by mixing class activity and youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpMhMUcmLJw&t=372s&ab_channel=AndyMcDonald
 The instructions given on the description for Module 5 challenge were very insightful
